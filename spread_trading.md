Spread trading involves the simultaneous purchase of one financial instrument and the sale of another financial instrument with the objective of profiting from not the movement of the absolute value of the two prices, but the movement of the spread between the two prices.

A stochastic process for the price spread and its first hitting time probability density are employed.

The expected profit from a simple spread trading strategy is influenced by the degree of mean reversion and volatility. More precisely, we have formulated the expected return from spread convergence and failure to converge cases using a simple mean-reverting spread model characterized by κ and σ.
